# linkedin_clone
Clone of [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/linkedinlearning/) to practise Flexbox and alignment

## Features
-	I chose this project to gain a solid understanding of Flexbox and CSS alignment, as cloning this website required aligning many small intricate elements.
-	Clean design
-	CSS variables
-	Refactoring CSS

## Note on responsiveness
- This project is not responsive. For my responsive design skills, please see my [travelnews](https://github.com/chrisenoch/travelnews) project, where I implement media queries with Sass conditionals.
